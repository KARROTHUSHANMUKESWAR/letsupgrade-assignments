COMPILER:
1.compiler checks whether there are any mistakes(such as grammer mistakes in the code written),if there are any errrors in the syntax we have to correct the syntax.
2.compiler wont make any corrections in the code.
3.compiler just convert the high level programming language into machine level language.
4.compiled code runs faster.
5.machine code is stored in disk storage
6.program is not executed untill the errors are solved
7.gives intermediate code forms.
INTERPRETER:
1.interpreter converts source code line by line during the execution.
2.it allows evaluation and modification during execution.
3.interpreted code run slower.
4.machine code is not at all saved
5.The program runs till the error is found and proceeds further on resolving.
6.no intermediate forms are there.
